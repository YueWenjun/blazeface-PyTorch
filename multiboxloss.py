    SSD Weighted Loss Function
    Compute Targets:
        1) Produce Confidence Target Indices by matching ground truth boxes
           with (default) 'priorboxes'.
        2) Produce locatization target by 'encoding' variance into offsets of ground
           truth boxes and their matched 'priorboxes'.
        3) Hard negative mining to filter the excessive number of negative examples
           that comes with using a large number of default bounding boxes.
           (default negative:positive ratio 3:1)
    Objective Loss:
        L(x,c,l,g) = (Lconf(x, c) + Î±Lloc(x, l ,g)) / N
        where, Lconf is the CrossEntropy Loss and Lloc is the SmoothL1 Loss
        weighted by a which is set to 1 by cross val
